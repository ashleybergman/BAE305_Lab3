# Summary
The goal of this lab was to use a simulation software to find Kirchhoff's voltage law and Kirchhoff's current law. The online software, Partism, is very useful for evaluating and analyzing circuits or systems without actually constructing them. Another goal of this lab was to apply the superposition and Thevenin's theorems to the analysis of electrical circuits and to confirm the validity of these theorems. 

# Materials
Breadboard, computer with Partism and TinkerCAD circuit software, DC power supply, Resistors with the following values: 1kOhms, 2.2kOhms, 5.1kOhms, 4.7kOhms, 220kOhms, 6.8kOhms, 10kOhms, 3.3kOhms, and 470kOhms.

# Assembly Procedure

# Test Equipment
Fluke and the multimeter. The multimeter was used to measure the voltage drop across each resistor but was not used to measure current to prevent more fuses from being blown. The current was measured on the simulation software.
